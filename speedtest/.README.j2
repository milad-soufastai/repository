Scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

## About

InfluxDB2 is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

This add-on is built on the InfluxDB v2.x build. \
If you're after the InfluxDB V1.x build - check out this other add-on [Here][Influxdbv1]

[Read the full add-on documentation][docs]

## FAQ
- Why make another add-on and why not just upgrade the current [InfluxDB v1.x Community Add-on][Influxdbv1]?
  - The upgrade path from V1.x to V2.x requires access to the command line and isn't a very user friendly process. So I decided to create a new add-on and start from there.
- This doesn't support Home Assistant Ingress web interface - why not?
  - Unfortunately the way the ingress works requires the application to support a Base URL rewrite of some form and the InfluxDB2 project currently doesn't.
- Are kapacitor and chronograf both still avaliable in this build?
  - No, neither are included as InfluxDB2 now includes a UI and most features from these other packages.
